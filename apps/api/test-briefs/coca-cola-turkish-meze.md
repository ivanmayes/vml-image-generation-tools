# Coca-Cola Turkish Meze Food Photography Brief

## Technical Parameters

- **Aspect Ratio**: 16:9 (horizontal/landscape orientation)
- **Angle**: Intimate mid-angle shot, approximately 20-30 degrees down from eye-level
- **Lens Aesthetic**: 50mm prime lens. Natural perspective with minimal distortion
- **Aperture/Focus**: f/2.2, creating a shallow depth of field. The sharpest focus is critically on the central Fava dish and the foreground Coca-Cola glass. The 2L bottle in the midground is sharp but slightly softer than the hero glass, and the background place setting is gently softened into bokeh
- **Lighting**: Soft, directional natural daylight streams in from a large window off-camera to the left. It creates beautiful highlights on the 2L Coca-Cola bottle, the heavy condensation on the glasses, and the glistening pool of olive oil on the fava. The scene has a gentle warmth and soft shadows are cast to the right

## Composition & Narrative

### The Scene

A vibrant, communal meze spread for a small family gathering. No human presence. The composition is focused on a hero place setting, creating an inviting, authentic scene—a shared meal awaiting its family.

### Framing

The hero Fava dish and the Coca-Cola elements (bottle and glass) are positioned within the central vertical third of the 16:9 frame, creating a tight, balanced composition that draws the eye.

### Mood

Warm, inviting, convivial, photorealistic, authentic Turkish home comfort.

## Setting & Ambiance

- **Location**: A warm, rustic Turkish home dining area
- **Surface**: A worn dark wood dining table with visible character, natural grain, and a matte finish
- **Background**: Softly blurred domestic Turkish setting with hints of simple off-white walls. A second, simpler place setting is visible across the table in soft bokeh, creating a sense of depth and shared dining

## Key Objects (Strict Inventory)

### Central Hero Dish (Fava)

- A single round, rustic ceramic serving plate (off-white or light earthenware with a handmade feel)
- **Content**: A generous portion of smooth, velvety fava purée, topped with a glistening pool of golden-green olive oil. The dish is garnished with a liberal scattering of fresh, vibrant green dill and a central cluster of finely diced purple onion
- Positioned in the central vertical third of the frame

### The Utensils & Napkin

- Positioned to the RIGHT of the hero dish: A simple folded linen napkin (natural beige color)
- Resting on the napkin: A stainless steel fork and knife

### The Coca-Cola Element (HERO BEVERAGE)

**Bottle**:

- One 2L Classic Coca-Cola PET bottle
- Position: In the midground, just to the right of and slightly behind the hero Fava dish, creating a tight visual lockup
- The full height of the bottle, including the cap, is visible
- The label is clean, unobstructed, and facing the camera

**Glasses**:

- Two 640mL Coca-Cola Contour glasses
- The hero glass is at the top right of the hero place setting, filled 3/4 with cola, cubed ice, and covered in heavy condensation droplets
- The second glass is visible in the background setting

### The Bread Basket

- Position: In the right third of the frame, in the midground, balancing the composition
- A rustic, round woven wicker basket
- Content: Several warm, fluffy wedges of Turkish Pide bread with a soft, inviting texture

## Final Notes

- **No human elements whatsoever**—no hands, arms, or people
- The scene implies a gathering, but the focus is on the hero place setting
- **Coca-Cola is the ONLY beverage**—the refreshment hero
- 16:9 composition with central vertical third framing for the dish and Coke elements
- The entire scene feels ready, warm, and inviting—a perfect Turkish meze moment captured in time, with an ice-cold Coca-Cola as the perfect pairing
- The table is tidy - no crumbs or spills. This is a beautiful food photography image highlighting the deliciousness and beauty of the space and its content
